This repository contains a scraped dataset of player statistics for the 30 men's nominees of the 2025 Ballon d'Or, focused on top 5 European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1). Data sourced from FBref.com for the 2024â€“25 season.

## Dataset Overview
- **Columns**: Player, Nation, Pos, Squad, Gls, Ast, Min, Gls/90, xG, League (added for source tracking), and more (full stats like playing time, per-90 metrics).
- **Files**:
  - `all_nominees_stats.csv`: Merged dataset with nominees only (~30 rows).
  - League-specific CSVs (e.g., `premier_nominees.csv`) in `/data/raw/`.
- **Filtering**: Only Ballon d'Or nominees included, using a predefined list of names.
- **Scraping Method**: Used Python with pandas, requests, and BeautifulSoup to scrape FBref tables from commented HTML sections.

3. Analyze: e.g., `df.nlargest(5, 'Gls')` for top scorers.

## Scraping Reproduction

2. Extract commented tables via BeautifulSoup.
3. Flatten multi-index columns.
4. Filter for nominees: `df[df['Player'].isin(nominees_list)]`.
